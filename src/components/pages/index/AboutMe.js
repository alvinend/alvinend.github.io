        Allow me to tell you about Myself
      </h1>
      <p className="text-gray-600 mt-40 w-3/5 mx-auto">
        Hey there, my name is <b>Alvin</b>. I program stuff. Born in Indonesia, but there are many places I can call home. Now a Student at Kyoto Computer Collage.
        When I'm not busy, you can find me watching a movie or just in front of computer programming stuff.
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-400 my-20 font-semibold">Weapon</h2>
        I'm always learning web technologies and other design-related topics, currently studying Computer Networking. I also focus on many areas of design and web development. As the primary weapon,
        I'm using <b>React</b> as my front-end framework and Photoshop as a graphic and web design tool.
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-400 my-20 font-semibold">Me Designing</h2>
        Unlike many designers, my design doesn't start with a pencil. I always start by grabbing my mouse and lookups for inspiration from the internet. From there,
        Ideas begin to pop up in my head. Then add the imagery, typography design, and details.
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-400 my-20 font-semibold">Me Progamming</h2>
        For development, I write many things. Starting from web development to machine. For those interested, the text editor I use is VS Studio Code as IDE. I learning mainly
        javascript for front-end dev (mainly React) and Ruby for back-end dev (of course Ruby on Rails) These are the basic tools I use on my job and are my daily set up.
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-400 my-20 font-semibold">Me Writing</h2>
        This is a new and hobby kind of thing, I want to write blogs about my life, technology, and many more, and this website is my starting point.
        I am going to try updating constantly.

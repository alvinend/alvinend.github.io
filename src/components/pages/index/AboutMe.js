        Hey there, my name is <b>Alvin</b>. I program stuff. Born in Indonesia, but there are many places I can call home. Now a Student at Kyoto Computer Collage.
        When I'm not busy, you can find me watching a movie, playing with dogs or just in front of computer programming stuff.

        I'm always learning web technologies and other design-related topics, currently studying Computer Networking. I'm focusing mainly on Cloud Infrastructure (mainly AWS) and
        sometime, front-end. 
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-400 my-20 font-semibold">Why Web Infrastructure?</h2>
        I tried many role in web service development, from designer, front-end, back-end and server infrastructure. The reason why I like managing server or web infrastructrue
        is that I can feel the user using it. Just to know that, there are many user is communicating with the server that I build is fascinating.
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-400 my-20 font-semibold">Why Front End?</h2>
        The distance between server and front-end is far. Then you may ask, why front end? The reason for that is, First, front-end is the section of web developing 
        that I learnt first. My first programing language that I learnt is Javascript (and HTML and CSS but those two are not programming language). Secondly,
        with front-end I create what user use. For example, When I code a button, I imagine the user pushing it. In that perspective managing infrastructrue and front-end
        is kind of same in my opinion.
        <h2 className="text-2xl text-red-400 my-20 font-semibold">Me Writing</h2>
        Let me tell you that I'm not good writing. Neither at my main language Indonesan, Japaneses nor English. But I like sharing, so decide to make a blog!
        I want to write blogs about my life, technology, and many more, and this website is my starting point. Feel free to criticize my writing.

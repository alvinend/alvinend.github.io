I have been living in Japan for five years, and there is something I like and dislike about it. Here are the lists:

# Love Japan!

There are many things that I love about Japan, from the food that are tasty, a unique sight that you can only see in Japan and the people.

## I Love Ramen!

Japan has many great foods. From yakitori, takoyaki, taiyaki, and much more. I like all of them, especially Ramen. Ramen is phenomenal. I was not too fond of Japanese Ramen in Indonesia, although Ramen here is so good. It is cheap and everywhere so I can eat it whenever I want, if you by any chance come to Japan I suggest eating one or two Ramen

 When people go to another country for a long time they started to miss their country food after a while, strangely enough, the food here agree with my palate and make me forget how good Indonesian food was.

## Red is my Favorite Color

Japan is famous for its Sakura. Sakura is s Japan's unofficial national flower. It has been celebrated for many centuries and holds a very prominent position in Japanese culture. While it is pretty, I love Momiji more than Sakura.

Momiji is when leaves have turned red in the autumn. The reason I like it more than Sakura is that it is red and the autumn vibe. Like sakura season, people in Japan go flower viewing in this season.

## People are kind

Japanese are very polite and kind because of their culture. The service at restaurants is no like other countries. They think that customers are the most important being.

Stranger too, if you ask something, most of them will try helping you to the extent of their power. They do so much sometimes make me feel bad for asking.

Unfortunately, While there are many kind peoples, I'm sorry that I cannot say that they are all kind. I met some rude people in Japan who hate foreigners. So if you are planning to study or work in Japan, gathering information and advice is never a bad idea.



# Japan is not a perfect country

Japan is a great country, but it is not perfect. There are things that I'm not crazy about Japan.

## Life Need Money

When you want to come to study in Japan and from a developing country, you need to think about the cost of living in Japan. Even you are permitted to do part-time work, there is a limit on how much you can work, and also, if you manage to get high paying work, there are taxes that become higher as your income get higher.

## People are wearing masks

Like I said earlier, Japanese is kind because of the culture, which doesn't mean that they kind from the inside. You cannot tell if one likes you or not, and that makes it difficult to make friends.

I manage to make some friends when working on Izakaya, but it takes time to see their faces behind the mask. One indication is they will invite you to drink some alcohol together.



# Ending

Japan is a perfect country as a vacation destination, but when it comes to moving in, please do some thinking first. There are many of my friends that go home before reaching their goals.

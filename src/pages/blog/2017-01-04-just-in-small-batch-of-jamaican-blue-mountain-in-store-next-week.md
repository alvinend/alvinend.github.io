  If we think about the Corona, we think of something horrible, fear, terror,
  and other negative vibes. We see panic buy everywhere from masks and toilet
  paper to hand sanitizer and other necessities.

  But in all of this situation, how about taking a second and look from
  positive-glasses. Experiencing something like never before (Lockdown, not able
  to work for months) makes me learn and something important.

If we think about the Corona, we think of something horrible, fear, terror, and other negative vibes. We see panic buy everywhere from masks and toilet paper to hand sanitizer and other necessities.

But in all of this situation, how about taking a second and look from positive-glasses. Experiencing something like never before (Lockdown, not able to work for months) makes me learn and something important. Here is the list:

# Reunion

In our busy lives, we often forget what is important to us, for instance, family, friends, and even time for yourself. Corona makes our time and space for that. It makes us time just to lay down and to relax with people we love. Take this chance to tell them you love them!



In my case, I got to talk to my best friend from 10 years ago, high-school video call reunion, and rethinking myself my future. Things that I cannot do thin before because too busy with studies and works.



# Self Improvement

Lockdown and not able to work means that there is a lot of time doing whatever we want. One of those is self-improvement. Corona gives us to do something you always wanted, from playing guitar, studying chess, or just medicate. I learned a lot of things during this lockdown. If not for Corona, I wouldn't bother to create and write this blog.



# Rest and Leisure

Some of us worked too hard, stressed, and burnout. It reduces productivity and saps your energy, leaving you feeling increasingly helpless, hopeless, cynical, and resentful. Eventually, you may feel like you have nothing more to give.



If you are one of them, Corona makes a chance for us to rest, to motivate and energize us for tomorrow.

# Ending

I do feel sorry for one who got infected, or the loved one passed by because of Corona, but we cannot do this with negative vibes haunting our minds. By being positive, we make this more bearable for ourself maybe also people around us.

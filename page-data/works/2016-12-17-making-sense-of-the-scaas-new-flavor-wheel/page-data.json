Here is why:</p>\n<h1>Why I Choose Front-end</h1>\n<h2>Is relatively comparable</h2>\n<p>Browsing through websites, we see both good and bad, easy or hard to use, and from there we can compare our creation to a successful or beautiful website. I know if our result is good enough for a job or post it on the public.</p>\n<p>I'm not saying back-end is not comparable but is more difficult than front-end. We compare back-end by speed, reliability, and other things that the difference many time we don't even feel it.</p>\n<h2>Getting the result while developing</h2>\n<p>Front-end development allows us to see our website even if it is on the development stage. when seeing something I work on making progress and it motivates me more to add more features, improve the website into what I'm proud of calling my creation.</p>\n<h2>Creativity plays a role</h2>\n<p>There is no right answer on how a website should be build or design. That makes browsing more fun. Front-end web development is all about creativity and creative problem-solving. As a front-end web developer, you’ll have the skills to build customized websites to create the best possible user experience.</p>\n<h2>A Constantly evolving field.</h2>\n<p>Front-end web development is an exciting career because it’s always evolving and constantly changing. Even though many people hate this because what you master now may not be relevant 10 years later, I’ll always have the opportunity to interact with new tools and learn new skills, keeping you engaged in your career and I like it.</p>\n<p>After learning front-end and getting a position as an intern, I can say that I love front-end and looking for its development in the future.</p>\n<h1>How should one get started on Front-End</h1>\n<p>I write this based on my experience and may not apply to all people but this is how I would suggest to others how to start.</p>\n<h2>Learn the basic</h2>\n<p>My mistake is not learning enough of basic. HTML, CSS , Javascript, DOM etc. Enough basic can help you in the long run, don't jump to fast into a framework. Knowing enough Javascript will help you learn a framework much faster than not knowing Javascript.</p>\n<h2></h2>\n<h2>So how do you know when you got the basic?</h2>\n<p>Everybody has a different standard on \"knowing the basic\", mine is when you can create what you want. You can create any website layout when you can put a design into code that is when \"knowing the basic\" is done in my opinion.</p>\n<p>Other than development skills I highly recommend getting a strong understanding of what is web developers do. The definition of UI and UX, API, SPA, SSR, and many others.</p>\n<h2>Try before choosing</h2>\n<p>After learning the basic you can make anything you want. While it is possible to do it vanilla way, there is a limit on how big of the website/ web app you can make before it becomes complicated and unreadable. This where the framework takes place.</p>\n<p>A framework helps you create a complex HTML, CSS, and Javascript. there are many frameworks in front-end development, before choosing one I suggest you try a minimal 2 different framework before deciding. It will help you to understand how frameworks work and find a perfect framework for you</p>\n<p>Finally, they empower you with a shared language to discuss your architecture and challenges.</p>\n<h1>Ending</h1>\n<p>Front-end is challenging, fun, and it is easy and hard at the same time. it can be something that sometimes refreshing and sometimes overwhelming and cause stress burnout. The best thing to do is taking it your phase and don't compare to other</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 07, 2020","title":"About Front-end Web Development","description":"Even though I'm studying Computer Science Network (which has no relation with front-end stuff) I decided that learning front-end is a good idea.
